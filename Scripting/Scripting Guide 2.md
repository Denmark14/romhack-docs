# Scripting Basics

Once you have ev-as setup per the readme in the [repository](https://github.com/z80rotom/ev-as)

Reminder: You want to edit the scripts in the `scripts` folder, not parsed. If you don't have a scripts folder, make one and paste your parsed scripts here.

Also, when copying over your script changes to your emulator/switch for testing, you want to take the `ev_scripts` file from the `bin` folder, not `Dpr`, as `Dpr` will not have the changes.
